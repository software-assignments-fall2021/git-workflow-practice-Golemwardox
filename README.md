I found this article interesting because it gave me a different outlook on Agile methodologies, rather than just the Scrum Methodology. Kanban is primarily visually workflow management environment and "encourages steadily collaboration and maintains active, continuous learning and enhancement through describing the best plausible team workflow." Extreme Programming focuses on increasing customer satisfaction, and delivers only what the customer demands at present. The Crystal methodology is a culmination many other small agile methodologies that incorporate together. It seems that this methodology has an emphasis on team size. I find it fascinating that there are many different styles of agile methodologies that all achieve the same goal in the end, but find different values to focus on. I wonder how teams figure out the agile methodology that works best for them, and what it takes for a group to decide that their current methodology is not working.
